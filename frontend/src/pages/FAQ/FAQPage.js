          question: "What languages does CommendAI support?",
          answer: "CommendAI supports 5 major languages: English, Turkish, Russian, Chinese (Simplified), and Japanese. Each language model is trained to understand cultural context and produce native-level quality comments with appropriate expressions and idioms."
        },
        {
          question: "How accurate and relevant are the generated comments?",
          answer: "Our AI achieves 90%+ relevance accuracy by analyzing multiple video elements: title, description, transcript (when available), existing comments, and channel context. Comments are designed to feel natural and contextually appropriate to the video content."
        },

          question: "Can I customize the style or tone of generated comments?",
          answer: "Yes! CommendAI offers multiple comment styles including casual, professional, enthusiastic, analytical, and humorous tones. The AI adapts its language patterns and expressions to match your selected style while maintaining relevance to the video."
        },
        {
          question: "Does CommendAI work with all types of YouTube videos?",
          answer: "CommendAI works with most public YouTube videos including tutorials, vlogs, music videos, gaming content, educational videos, and entertainment content. However, it may not work with private videos, age-restricted content, or videos with disabled comments."

        {
          question: "How fast is the comment generation process?",
          answer: "Comment generation typically takes 3-8 seconds depending on video complexity and server load. Our optimized AI models and cloud infrastructure ensure consistently fast performance while maintaining high-quality output."

        },
        {
          question: "What happens if the video URL doesn't work?",
          answer: "If a video URL fails, CommendAI provides specific error messages: invalid URL format, video not found, private/restricted video, or regional restrictions. The tool includes URL validation and suggests corrections for common formatting issues."
        },
        {
          question: "Is there a limit to how many comments I can generate?",
          answer: "There are no hard limits on comment generation. However, to ensure quality service for all users, we implement fair usage policies during peak times. For typical use (under 100 comments per hour), you won't encounter any restrictions."

      questions: [
        {
          question: "What data does CommendAI collect and store?",
          answer: "CommendAI collects minimal data: generated comments (stored locally in your browser), video URLs for processing, and anonymous usage statistics. We do NOT store personal information, YouTube credentials, or browsing history. All data processing follows GDPR compliance standards."
        },
        {
          question: "Is my YouTube account information safe?",
          answer: "Absolutely! When using direct posting features, authentication is handled through YouTube's official OAuth system. CommendAI never stores your YouTube credentials or personal account information. All connections are encrypted and secure."
        },

      questions: [
        {
          question: "Why did comment generation fail?",
          answer: "Common reasons include: invalid YouTube URL, video restrictions (private/age-restricted), network connectivity issues, or temporary server load. Try refreshing the page, checking your internet connection, or using a different video URL."
        },
        {
          question: "The generated comment doesn't match the video content. What should I do?",
          answer: "Occasionally, AI may miss context due to limited video information or unclear content. Try regenerating the comment, or manually edit the output. You can also report inaccurate results to help improve our AI models."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I use CommendAI on mobile devices?",
          answer: "Yes! CommendAI is fully responsive and works seamlessly on smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers. The mobile experience is optimized for touch interfaces with the same powerful features as the desktop version."

        {
          question: "Should I always post AI-generated comments as-is?",
          answer: "We recommend reviewing and potentially customizing generated comments to match your personal voice and add authentic touches. While our AI produces high-quality content, adding personal insights or experiences enhances authenticity and engagement."
        },
        {
          question: "How can content creators benefit from CommendAI?",
          answer: "Content creators can use CommendAI to: engage with their audience more effectively, respond to comments on their videos, participate in community discussions, analyze successful comment patterns, and maintain consistent engagement across multiple channels."
